# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is the C code for a tic tac toe game.

Steps ->
1/ This is a simple 2-player game on a 3x3 board which is updated and printed everytime a player makes a correct move (so that the console appears clean).
2/ Then, I have used a for loop to take input from both players until anyone wins the game or the game is drawn.

This program was written by me as part of a challenge while learning C language and it was tough for me to write this code a couple of months back.
However, I have left my code untouched even though it may not be that efficient because I really like looking back at it even today.

Not a very big project, but yes, I have written it by myself!
